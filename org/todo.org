* fix
** it should be an error for two notes with the same name to go to two different `SynthDefEnum`s
** use museqIsValid in join|transform tests
*** and test the new museqIsValid's extra clauses
* add
** abbreviations for map functions, imported as M
*** M.fl = M.fromList
*** M.u = M.union
** parse a DSL for it
*** seems much easier to make the DSL after the functions it will encode
*** for every bit of terse punctuation, include a verbal alternative
**** => easier to remember, easier to search for language constructs
** not super important
*** space: play a duration n < k loop over duration k.
**** Was hard in Tidal, but maybe append makes it easy.
* supercollider mysteries
** envelopes
** many voices to one distortion
** slow changes, e.g. for slide guitar
* DONE problems that seem solved
** bug ! melodies get mangled if tempo is near 1 but not 1
*** the problem was floating point error in `arc`, solved by using only Rationals as times
** chTempo: continuity
*** when changing tempo, figure out how many cycles have passed since time0
*** rewrite time0 so it's still true at the new tempo
* once it's publishable
** add Cabal install notes. Tom made suggestions in the seventh message of the haskell-art thread, "fVivid: Some code that parses instructions to synths polymorphically"
