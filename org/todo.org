* architecture mysteries
** Museq Action vs. Museq Msg
*** should separate(not part of the same GHC-evaluated expression) Museqs control the same synth?
*** will harmony be a function of multiple Museq Actions?
** Many voices to one harmonizer
** Distribute concurrent notes across synths
*** automatically, rather than requiring the user to say which go where.
** [dubious] Represent a Museq in more than one way
*** Refactoring Museq to simply include end times took 10 hours today (August 20) plus a few yesterday.

* ! polyphonic is hard
** ideas|questions
*** How to generate names, and avoid name conflict, when voices bifurcate?
*** use an "on" parameter, just like amp, so that amp is not forgotten
*** should number of voices be robust to reversal?
**** e.g. consider the pattern "f f, x, f". Played forward, there would be two voices (because two f values) during the x, but backward, there would not.
*** bury Msgs inside a more muscai type
*** skip info if possible -- name, amp, on|off, end time
** the problem
*** Suppose pattern p has two freqs at one point, and later two amps. 
*** Should it render as four melodies? 
*** If it's only two melodies, which freq matches to which amp?
*** Should the bifurcation caused by a double-instruction persist after it ends? Precede it?
*** What happens when you merge or meta a polyphonic pattern with another?
*** Is stack useless on Msgs, and only useful on Actions?
* fix
** use museqIsValid in join|transform tests
*** and test the new museqIsValid's extra clauses
* add
** scales, harmonies
** parse a DSL for it
*** seems much easier to make the DSL after the functions it will encode
*** for every bit of terse punctuation, include a verbal alternative
**** => easier to remember, easier to search for language constructs
** not super important
*** space: play a duration n < k loop over duration k. 
**** Was hard in Tidal, but maybe append makes it easy.
* supercollider mysteries
** envelopes
** many voices to one distortion
** slow changes, e.g. for slide guitar
* problems that seem solved
** bug ! melodies get mangled if tempo is near 1 but not 1
*** the problem was floating point error in `arc`, solved by using only Rationals as times
** chTempo: continuity
*** when changing tempo, figure out how many cycles have passed since time0
*** rewrite time0 so it's still true at the new tempo
