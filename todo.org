* features to add, in cumulative order
** make functions for manipulating loops
*** spend a long time on this
** parse a DSL for it
*** seems much easier to make the DSL after the functions it will encode
*** for every bit of terse punctuation, include a verbal alternative
**** => easier to remember, easier to search for language constructs
* more features, not ordered
** A synth plan can be represented multiple ways:
*** Each has a total duration
*** An ordered sequence of (duration, synth message) pairs.
*** Extant synths are never off; time between notes = amplitude zero
** A collection of concurrent notes has to be distributed across synths
*** automatically, rather than requiring the user to say which go where.
