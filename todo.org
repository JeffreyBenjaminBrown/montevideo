* *merge (see debating-endpoints.md)
* museqIsValid: test that endpoints do not lead starts
* use museqIsValid in join|transform tests
** and test the new museqIsValid's extra clauses
* rewriting DistribLoop
** maybe adding frameDuration to startRender is unnecessary.
*** If so, adjust this function, and also replaceAll, chTempo, etc. -- maybe everything that calls getTime.
* supercollider mysteries
** envelopes
** many voices to one distortion
** slow changes, e.g. for slide guitar
* features to add, in roughly cumulative order
** chTempo: continuity
*** when changing tempo, figure out how many cycles have passed since time0
*** rewrite time0 so it's still true at the new tempo
** scales, harmonies
** distribute concurrent notes across synths
*** automatically, rather than requiring the user to say which go where.
** A synth plan can be represented multiple ways:
*** Each has a total duration
*** An ordered sequence of (duration, synth message) pairs.
*** Extant synths are never off; time between notes = amplitude zero
** parse a DSL for it
*** seems much easier to make the DSL after the functions it will encode
*** for every bit of terse punctuation, include a verbal alternative
**** => easier to remember, easier to search for language constructs
* not super important
** space: play a duration n < k loop over duration k. 
*** Was hard in Tidal, but maybe append makes it easy.
