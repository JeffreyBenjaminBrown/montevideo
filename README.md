# Montevideo is some music tools

It can be used for:

* `mtv-lang`: live-coding
* `mtv-monome`: playing via a [monome](https://monome.org/)
* `mtv-earTrain`: ear training
* `mtv-ji`: music theory

Most of those have a separate README.
I haven't documented the ear training and music theory modules well,
but if I see evidence that anybody else wants to use them, I might.


# Hacking it

I'm not sure how helpful they are,
but my own notes on montevideo can be found at my public org-roam knowledge graph,
at https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/notes-in-org-format-on-tech
You don't need to use org-roam to read them;
they are ordinary .org-formatted notes.


# Why the name

It's a mashup of monome, Tidal(Cycles) and Vivid.
